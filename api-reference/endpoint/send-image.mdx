## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Optimize Image Size">
    Compress images before uploading to ensure fast delivery. Tools like TinyPNG can help reduce file size without quality loss.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use CDN URLs">
    Host images on a CDN (CloudFront, Cloudflare, etc.) for reliable and fast access worldwide.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Meaningful Captions">
    Captions provide context and can include calls-to-action, making your images more effective.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test URLs First">
    Verify that image URLs are accessible by opening them in a browser before sending.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Caption text supports the same formatting as text messages: `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `~strikethrough~`, and `` `monospace` ``.
