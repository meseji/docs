## Migration Overview

Migrating (or "porting") your number allows you to switch from providers like Twilio, MessageBird, or the Meta Cloud API to **Meseji** while keeping your verified status and phone number.



---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have completed these steps to prevent migration failure.

<Warning>
  **Disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** You must turn off 2FA in your current BSP's dashboard. If Meta detects a PIN is active on the source account, the migration will be blocked.
</Warning>

* **Meta Business Manager Admin:** You must have admin access to the Facebook Business Account.
* **Phone Access:** You must be able to receive an SMS or Voice call on the number you are migrating.
* **Active Status:** The number must not be currently banned or flagged by Meta.

## The Migration Steps

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Prep the Source Account
  Log in to your current provider (e.g., Twilio, Gupshup) and:
  1.  **Disable 2FA/Registration PIN.**
  2.  Verify the number is "Connected."
  3.  Keep the dashboard open; you may need it to check for incoming OTPs.

  ### Step 2: Launch the Meseji Onboarding
  In your [Meseji Dashboard](https://meseji.app/dashboard), click **Add Channel** and select **WhatsApp Business API**.
  * Choose the **Migrate Existing Number** option.
  * Click "Continue with Facebook" to open the Meta Embedded Signup.

  ### Step 3: Select Business Assets
  Inside the Meta popup:
  1.  Select the **Meta Business Account** that currently owns the number.
  2.  Select or create the **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)** you want to use with Meseji.
  3.  When prompted for the phone number, enter the number you are porting.

  ### Step 4: Identity Verification
  Meta will send a 6-digit code via SMS or Voice. 
  * Select your preferred method.
  * Enter the code in the popup.
  * Once verified, the number will officially move to Meseji’s management.
</Steps>

## Post-Migration Config

Once the migration is complete, your old API credentials will no longer work. Update your application to point to Meseji.
