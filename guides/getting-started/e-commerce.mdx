## 🚀 Top Advanced Use Cases

### 1. The "Native Checkout" Cart Recovery
Recover up to 35% of lost revenue by removing the friction of moving from WhatsApp back to a website.
* **The Workflow:** When a user abandons a cart on Shopify/WooCommerce, Meseji triggers a **Carousel Template**.
* **Advanced Detail:** Instead of a link, use a **"Buy Now"** button. This opens the **WhatsApp Native Cart**, where users see the product, price, and a "Pay" button instantly.
* **Cost Efficiency:** By classifying this as a "Checkout Update," you can often use the **Utility Rate (₹0.115)** instead of Marketing (₹0.86).

### 2. COD to Prepaid "Nudge" (RTO Prevention)
High Return-to-Origin (RTO) rates kill e-commerce margins. Use WhatsApp to secure payments before shipping.
* **The Workflow:** Once a COD order is placed, send an automated confirmation.
* **The Advanced Hook:** "Your COD order is confirmed! **Pay now via UPI and get an extra ₹50 cashback.**"
* **Integration:** Direct integration with **WhatsApp Pay (UPI)** or Razorpay/PayU embedded checkout.

### 3. AI-Powered Personal Shopper
Increase WAU by turning your WhatsApp into a conversational catalog.
* **Discovery:** Users can type "Show me red sneakers under ₹3000."
* **The Response:** The bot queries your live catalog and returns a **Multi-Product Message** (MPM) with up to 30 items.
* **Engagement:** This interactive loop keeps users coming back weekly, creating a "Shopping Hub" rather than a spam channel.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

To achieve these results, Meseji connects your existing tech stack to the WhatsApp Business API.



### Integration Architecture
* **Webhooks:** Listen for `checkout_abandoned` or `order_created` events from your store.
* **Meta Catalog Sync:** Your Facebook Business Catalog is synced in real-time, allowing for "Product Set" messages.
* **Native Payments:** Use `UPI_INTENT` or deep integration with gateways like Razorpay for in-app payments.
