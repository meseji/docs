## 2. WhatsApp Messaging Fees (Meta Fees)

Meta charges for WhatsApp Business API usage based on **Conversations**. A conversation is a 24-hour window that starts when you message a customer or reply to one.

<Note>
  Meseji passes these costs through **without any markup**. You pay exactly what Meta charges.
</Note>

### Conversation Categories (2026 Update)

Meta categorizes conversations into four types, each with different rates depending on the recipient's country:

| Category | Description | Typical Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marketing** | Business-initiated promotions or offers. | Newsletters, discount codes. |
| **Utility** | Business-initiated transactional updates. | Order confirmations, shipping alerts. |
| **Authentication** | Business-initiated security codes. | OTPs, 2FA, password resets. |
| **Service** | User-initiated inquiries. | Customer support, product FAQs. |

### Free Tiers & Windows
* **Service Conversations:** The first 1,000 service conversations each month are **Free**.
* **24-Hour Window:** Any message sent within a 24-hour window of a user's message is considered part of a "Service" conversation.
* **Click-to-WhatsApp Ads:** Conversations starting from these ads are free for 72 hours.

## 3. How Payments Work

Meseji uses a **Prepaid Credit System** for your WhatsApp messaging fees to ensure your service is never interrupted.
