## 2. Meta Message Charges (India Rates)

Following Meta's **2025/2026 Billing Update**, charges have shifted toward a **per-message** model for business-initiated templates. Meseji passes these fees directly to you with **zero markup** on Starter and Growth plans.

| Message Type | Price per Message | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marketing** | **₹0.8631** | Promotions, newsletters, offers. |
| **Utility** | **₹0.115** | Order updates, shipping alerts. |
| **Authentication** | **₹0.115** | OTPs, login verifications. |
| **Service** | **FREE** | Support chats within 24h window. |

<Note>
  **The 24-Hour Service Window:** Any message you send as a reply to a customer within 24 hours of their last message is **completely free** of Meta charges.
</Note>

## 3. How Billing Works

Meseji simplifies your WhatsApp expenses into one dashboard.

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Subscription
  Your monthly plan (₹999 or ₹1,499) is billed at the start of your cycle. This keeps your dashboard, APIs, and team access active.
  
  ### Step 2: Messaging Wallet
  To send billable messages (Marketing, Utility, or OTP), you top up your **Messaging Wallet** with credits.
  
  ### Step 3: Real-Time Deduction
  As messages are delivered, Meta's official rate is deducted from your wallet balance in real-time. You can view detailed logs in **Billing > Usage**.
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Auto-Recharge:** We recommend enabling Auto-Recharge in your settings. If your wallet hits ₹0, Meta will pause your ability to send template messages.
</Tip>
